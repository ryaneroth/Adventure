You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the
Giant Room.  It appears to be a repository for the "Adventure"
program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky
yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all
of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed
of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and
a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves
are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A notice nearby reads: "Do
not disturb the dwarves!"  An immense mirror is hanging against one
wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other
sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.
