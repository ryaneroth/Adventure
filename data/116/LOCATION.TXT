You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a pit
full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small
wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one
corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A
large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.  A
vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your feet is a large
steel grate, next to which is a sign that reads, "Treasure Vault.
Keys in main office."
