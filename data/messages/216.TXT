As you rub the urn, there is a flash of light and a genie appears.
His aspect is stern as he advises: "One who wouldst traffic in
precious stones must first learn to recognize the signals thereof."
He wrests the urn from the stone, leaving a small cavity.  Turning to
face you again, he fixes you with a steely eye and intones: "Caution!"
Genie and urn vanish in a cloud of amber smoke.  The smoke condenses
to form a rare amber gemstone, resting in the cavity in the rock.
