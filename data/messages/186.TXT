There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you
turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.
He is carrying a large chest.  "Shiver me timbers!" he cries, "I've
been spotted!  I'd best hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest!"
With that, he vanishes into the gloom.
