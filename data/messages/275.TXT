Version 2.5 is essentially the same as Version II; the cave and the
hazards therein are unchanged, and top score is still 430 points.
There are a few more hints, especially for some of the more obscure
puzzles.  There are a few minor bugfixes and cosmetic changes.  You
can now save a game and resume it at once (formerly you had to wait a
while first), but it now costs you a few points each time you save the
game.  Saved games are now stored in much smaller files than before.
