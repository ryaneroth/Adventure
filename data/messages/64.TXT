The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-
growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of
various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by
all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the
spruce and berry bushes.
