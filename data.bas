#86
Dead end.
#87
You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
#88
You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight
to the west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which
you can see a profusion of leaves,
#89
There is nothing here to climb.  Use "up" or "out" to leave
the pit.
#90
You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.
#91
You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.
You could climb down here, but you would not be able to
climb up.  There is a passage leading back to the north.
#92
You are in the giant room.  The ceiling is too high up
for your lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east,
north, and south.  On the west wall is scrawled the
inscription:
              "Fee Fie Foe Foo"       {sic}
#93
The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.
#94
You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.
#95
You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream,
which cascades over a sparkling waterfall into a
roaring whirlpool which disappears through a hole in
the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.
#96
You are in the soft room.  The walls are covered with
heavy curtains, the floor with a thick pile carpet.
Moss covers the ceiling.
#97
This is the oriental room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings
cover the walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward
to the north, another passage leads se, and a hands and
knees crawl leads west.
#98
You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a
large cavern.  Far below, through a heavy white mist,
strange splashing noises can be heard.  The mist rises up
through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path exits to the
south and west.
#99
You are in an alcove.  A small nw path seems to widen
after a short distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads
east.  It looks like a very tight squeeze.  An eerie
light can be seen at the other end.
#100
You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  An
extremely narrow tunnel exits to the west.  A dark corridor
leads ne.
#101
You're in the dark-room.  A corridor leading south is the
only exit.
#102
You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continued
up and east from here, but is now blocked by debris.  The
air smells of sea water.
#103
You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.
The floor and walls are littered with bits of shells
imbedded in the stone.  A shallow passage proceeds
downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads up.  A low
hands and knees passage enters from the south.
#104
You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.
#105
You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.
#106
You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the
east.  Small passages go west and up.  The remnants of
recent digging are evident.  A sign in midair here says:
       "Cave under construction beyond this point."
              "Proceed at your own risk."
             "Witt construction company"
#107
You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
#108
You are at Witt's end.  Passages lead off in ALL directions.
#109
You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The
floor is covered by white mist seeping in from the north.
The walls extend upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended
from some unseen point far above you, an enormous two-
sided mirror is hanging paralled to and midway between
the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
for the use of the dwarves, who as you know, are
extremely vain.)  A small window can be seen in either
wall, some fifty feet up.
#110
You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which
extends up out of sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible
over 50 feet below.  Traces of white mist cover the floor
of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.  Marks in the
dust around the window would seem to indicate that
someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit
from you and 25 feet away there is a similar window
looking into a lighted room.  A shadowy figure can be seen
there peering back at you.
#111
A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches
the floor below.  You could climb down it, and jump from
it to the floor, but having done so you would be unable to
reach it to climb back up.
#112
You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.
#113
You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An
opaque cloud of white mist fills the room and rises
rapidly upward.  The lake is fed by a stream which tumbles
out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet overhead and
splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the mist.
The only passage goes back toward the south.
#114
Dead end.
#115
You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even
larger than the giant room.  It appears to be a repository
for the "adventure" program.  Massive torches far overhead
bathe the room with smoky yellow light.  Scattered about
you can be seen a pile of bottles (all of them empty), a
nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed of
oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their
ends, and a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side
a great many Dwarves are sleeping on the floor, snoring
loudly.  A sign nearby reads:
        "Do NOT disturb the Dwarves!"
An immense mirror is hanging against one wall, and
stretches to the other end of the room, where various
other sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.
#116
You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one
side is a pit full of fierce green snakes.  On the other
side is a row of small wicker cages, each of which contains
a little sulking bird.  In one corner is a bundle of
black rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A large
number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.
A vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your
feet is a large steel grate, next to which is a sign
which reads:
     "Treasure vault.  Keys in main office."
#117
You are on one side of a large deep chasm.  A heavy white
mist rising up from below obscures all view of the far
side.  A sw path leads away from the chasm into a winding
corridor.
#118
You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight
in both directions.
#119
You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
#120
You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
#121
You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
#122
You are on the far side of the chasm.  A ne path leads away
from the chasm on this side.
#123
You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noise
can be heard in the distance.
#124
The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull
rumbling seems to get louder in that direction.  The right
fork leads southeast down a gentle slope.  The main
corridor enters from the west.
#125
The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard
a steady roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be
trembling.  Another passage leads south, and a low crawl
goes east.
#126
You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an 
active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging 
out, cascading back down into the depths. The glowing rock fills the 
farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving 
everything an eerie, macabre appearance.
The air is filled with flickering sparks of ash and a heavy smell of 
brimstone.  The walls are hot to the touch, and the thundering of the 
volcano drowns out all other sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far 
overhead are myriad formations composed of pure white alabaster, which 
scatter their murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.
To one side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured 
rock which seems to have been crafted by the Devil Himself.  An 
immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the volcano, 
burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit 
far off to your left.  
To the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts 
continuously from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, 
which bubbles ominously. The far right wall is aflame with an 
incandescence of its own, which lends an additional infernal splendor 
to the already hellish scene.  
A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.
#127
You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.
The walls are very warm, causing the air in the room
to be almost stifling from the heat.  The only exit
is a crawl heading west, through which is coming
a low rumbling.
#128
You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage
lined with oddly shaped limestone formations.
#129
You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren
room.  A sign posted above the entrance reads:
       "Caution!  Bear in room!"
#130
You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room
is completely empty except for some dust.  Marks in
the dust lead away toward the far end of the room.
The only exit is the way you came in.
#131
You are in a maze of twisting little passages, all different.
#132
You are in a little maze of twisty passages, all different.

3	 THE GRATE IS LOCKED
103	 THE GRATE IS OPEN.
204	 THERE IS A SMALL WICKER CAGE DISCARDED NEARBY.
205	 A THREE FOOT BLACK ROD WITH A RUSTY STAR ON AN END LIES NEARBY
206	 ROUGH STONE STEPS LEAD DOWN THE PIT.
7	 A CHEERFUL LITTLE BIRD IS SITTING HERE SINGING.
107	 THERE IS A LITTLE BIRD IN THE CAGE.
8	 THE GRATE IS LOCKED
108	 THE GRATE IS OPEN.
209	 ROUGH STONE STEPS LEAD UP THE DOME.
210	 THERE IS A LARGE SPARKLING NUGGET OF GOLD HERE!
11	 A HUGE GREEN FIERCE SNAKE BARS THE WAY!
112	 A CRYSTAL BRIDGE NOW SPANS THE FISSURE.
213	 THERE ARE DIAMONDS HERE!
214	 THERE ARE BARS OF SILVER HERE!
215	 THERE IS PRECIOUS JEWELRY HERE!
216	 THERE ARE MANY COINS HERE!

120	 THERE IS AN EMPTY BOTTLE HERE.

INSTRUCTIONS WERE HERE

2	 A LITTLE DWARF WITH A BIG KNIFE BLOCKS YOUR WAY.
3	 A LITTLE DWARF JUST WALKED AROUND A CORNER,SAW YOU, THREW
3	 A LITTLE AXE AT YOU WHICH MISSED, CURSED, AND RAN AWAY.
4	 THERE IS A THREATENING LITTLE DWARF IN THE ROOM WITH YOU!
5	 ONE SHARP NASTY KNIFE IS THROWN AT YOU!
6	 HE GETS YOU!
7	 NONE OF THEM HIT YOU!
8	 A HOLLOW VOICE SAYS 'PLUGH'
9	 THERE IS NO WAY TO GO THAT DIRECTION.
10	 I AM UNSURE HOW YOU ARE FACING. USE COMPASS POINTS OR
10	 NEARBY OBJECTS.
11	 I DON'T KNOW IN FROM OUT HERE. USE COMPASS POINTS OR NAME
11	 SOMETHING IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION YOU WANT TO GO.
12	 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPLY THAT WORD HERE.
13	 I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT!
14	 I ALWAYS UNDERSTAND COMPASS DIRECTIONS, OR YOU CAN NAME
14	 A NEARBY THING TO HEAD THAT WAY.
15	 SORRY, BUT I AM NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE MORE DETAIL. I WILL
15	 REPEAT THE LONG DESCRIPTION OF YOUR LOCATION.
16	 IT IS NOW PITCH BLACK. IF YOU PROCEED YOU WILL LIKELY
16	 FALL INTO A PIT.
17	 IF YOU PREFER, SIMPLY TYPE W RATHER THAN WEST.
18	 ARE YOU TRYING TO CATCH THE BIRD?
19	 THE BIRD IS FRIGHTENED RIGHT NOW AND YOU CANNOT CATCH IT
19	 NO MATTER WHAT YOU TRY. PERHAPS YOU MIGHT TRY LATER.
20	 ARE YOU TRYING TO ATTACK OR AVOID THE SNAKE?
21	 YOU CAN'T KILL THE SNAKE, OR DRIVE IT AWAY, OR AVOID IT,
21	 OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. THERE IS A WAY TO GET BY, BUT YOU
21	 DON'T HAVE THE NECESSARY RESOURCES RIGHT NOW.
22	 MY WORD FOR HITTING SOMETHING WITH THE ROD IS 'STRIKE'.
23	 YOU FELL INTO A PIT AND BROKE EVERY BONE IN YOUR BODY!
24	 YOU ARE ALREADY CARRYING IT!
25	 YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS!
26	 THE BIRD WAS UNAFRAID WHEN YOU ENTERED, BUT AS YOU APPROACH
26	 IT BECOMES DISTURBED AND YOU CANNOT CATCH IT.
27	 YOU CAN CATCH THE BIRD, BUT YOU CANNOT CARRY IT.
28	 THERE IS NOTHING HERE WITH A LOCK!
29	 YOU AREN'T CARRYING IT!
30	 THE LITTLE BIRD ATTACKS THE GREEN SNAKE, AND IN AN
30	 ASTOUNDING FLURRY DRIVES THE SNAKE AWAY.
31	 YOU HAVE NO KEYS!
32	 IT HAS NO LOCK.
33	 I DON'T KNOW HOW TO LOCK OR UNLOCK SUCH A THING.
34	 THE GRATE WAS ALREADY LOCKED.
35	 THE GRATE IS NOW LOCKED.
36	 THE GRATE WAS ALREADY UNLOCKED.
37	 THE GRATE IS NOW UNLOCKED.
38	 YOU HAVE NO SOURCE OF LIGHT.
39	 YOUR LAMP IS NOW ON.
40	 YOUR LAMP IS NOW OFF.
41	 STRIKE WHAT?
42	 NOTHING HAPPENS.
43	 WHERE?
44	 THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO ATTACK.
45	 THE LITTLE BIRD IS NOW DEAD. ITS BODY DISAPPEARS.
46	 ATTACKING THE SNAKE BOTH DOESN'T WORK AND IS VERY DANGEROUS.
47	 YOU KILLED A LITTLE DWARF.
48	 YOU ATTACK A LITTLE DWARF, BUT HE DODGES OUT OF THE WAY.
49	 I HAVE TROUBLE WITH THE WORD 'THROW' BECAUSE YOU CAN THROW
49	 A THING OR THROW AT A THING. PLEASE USE DROP OR ATTACK INSTEAD.
50	 GOOD TRY, BUT THAT IS AN OLD WORN-OUT MAGIC WORD.

52	 IT MISSES!
53	 IT GETS YOU!
54	 OK
55	 YOU CAN'T UNLOCK THE KEYS.
56	 YOU HAVE CRAWLED AROUND IN SOME LITTLE HOLES AND WOUND UP
56	 BACK IN THE MAIN PASSAGE.
57	 I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE CAVE IS, BUT HEREABOUTS NO STREAM
57	 CAN RUN ON THE SURFACE FOR LONG. I WOULD TRY THE STREAM.
58	 I NEED MORE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS TO DO THAT.
59	 I CAN ONLY TELL YOU WHAT YOU SEE AS YOU MOVE ABOUT
59	 AND MANIPULATE THINGS. I CANNOT TELL YOU WHERE REMOTE THINGS
59	 ARE.
60	 I DON'T KNOW THAT WORD.
61	 WHAT?
62	 ARE YOU TRYING TO GET INTO THE CAVE?
63	 THE GRATE IS VERY SOLID AND HAS A HARDENED STEEL LOCK. YOU
63	 CANNOT ENTER WITHOUT A KEY, AND THERE ARE NO KEYS NEARBY.
63	 I WOULD RECOMMEND LOOKING ELSEWHERE FOR THE KEYS.
64	 THE TREES OF THE FOREST ARE LARGE HARDWOOD OAK AND MAPLE,
64	 WITH AN OCCASIONAL GROVE OF PINE OR SPRUCE. THERE IS QUITE
64	 A BIT OF UNDERGROWTH, LARGELY BIRCH AND ASH SAPLINGS PLUS
64	 NONDESCRITPT BUSHES OF VARIOUS SORTS. THIS TIME OF YEAR
64	 VISIBILITY IS QUITE RESTRICTED BY ALL THE LEAVES, BUT TRAVEL
64	 IS QUITE EASY IF YOU DETOUR AROUND THE SPRUCE AND BERRY BUSHES.

66	 DIGGING WITHOUT A SHOVEL IS QUITE IMPRACTICAL: EVEN WITH A
66	 SHOVEL PROGRESS IS UNLIKELY.
67	 BLASTING REQUIRES DYNAMITE.
68	 I'M AS CONFUSED AS YOU ARE.
69	 MIST IS A WHITE VAPOR, USUALLY WATER, SEEN FROM TIME TO TIME
69	 IN CAVERNS. IT CAN BE FOUND ANYWHERE BUT IS FREQUENTLY A SIGN
69	 OF A DEEP PIT LEADING DOWN TO WATER.
70	 YOUR FEET ARE NOW WET.
71	 THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO EAT.
72	 EATEN!
73	 THERE IS NO DRINKABLE WATER HERE.
74	 THE BOTTLE OF WATER IS NOW EMPTY.
75	 RUBBING THE ELECTRIC LAMP IS NOT PARTICULARLY REWARDING.
75	 ANYWAY, NOTHING EXCITING HAPPENS.
76	 PECULIAR.  NOTHING UNEXPECTED HAPPENS.
77	 YOUR BOTTLE IS EMPTY AND THE GROUND IS WET.
78	 YOU CAN'T POUR THAT.
79	 WATCH IT!
80	 WHICH WAY?
