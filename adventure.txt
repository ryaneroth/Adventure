300	The bird's singing is quite melodious.
400	The bird does not seem inclined to sing while in the cage.
500	It almost seems as though the bird is trying to tell you something.
600	To your surprise, you can understand the bird's chirping; it is
600	singing about the joys of its forest home.
700	The bird does not seem inclined to sing while in the cage.
800	The bird is singing to you in gratitude for your having returned it to
800	its home.  In return, it informs you of a magic word which it thinks
800	you may find useful somewhere near the Hall of Mists.  The magic word
800	changes frequently, but for now the bird believes it is "%W".  You
800	thank the bird for this information, and it flies off into the forest.

100	Interesting.  There seems to be something written on the underside of
100	the oyster.
200	Even though it's an oyster, the critter's as tight-mouthed as a clam.
300	It says the same thing it did before.  Hm, maybe it's a pun?
16	"Spelunker Today"
000	There are a few recent issues of "Spelunker Today" magazine here.
100	I'm afraid the magazine is written in dwarvish.  But pencilled on one

1	Somewhere nearby is Colossal Cave, where others have found fortunes in
1	treasure and gold, though it is rumored that some who enter are never
1	seen again.  Magic is said to work in the cave.  I will be your eyes
1	and hands.  Direct me with commands of 1 or 2 words.  I should warn
1	you that I look at only the first five letters of each word, so you'll
1	have to enter "northeast" as "ne" to distinguish it from "north".
1	You can type "help" for some general hints.  For information on how
1	to end your adventure, scoring, etc., type "info".

1	This program was originally developed by Willie Crowther.  Most of the
1	features of the current program were added by Don Woods.  Contact Don
1	if you have any questions, comments, etc.
2	A little dwarf with a big knife blocks your way.
3	A little dwarf just walked around a corner, saw you, threw a little
3	axe at you which missed, cursed, and ran away.
4	There are %1 threatening little dwarves in the room with you.
5	There is a threatening little dwarf in the room with you!
6	One sharp nasty knife is thrown at you!
7	A hollow voice says "PLUGH".
8	It gets you!
9	It misses!
10	I am unsure how you are facing.  Use compass points or nearby objects.
11	I don't know in from out here.  Use compass points or name something
11	in the general direction you want to go.
12	I don't know how to apply that word here.
13	You're quite welcome.
14	I'm game.  Would you care to explain how?
15	Sorry, but I am not allowed to give more detail.  I will repeat the
15	long description of your location.
16	It is now pitch dark.  If you proceed you will likely fall into a pit.
17	If you prefer, simply type w rather than west.
18	Are you trying to catch the bird?
19	Something about you seems to be frightening the bird.  Perhaps you
19	might figure out what it is.
20	Are you trying to somehow deal with the snake?
21	You can't kill the snake, or drive it away, or avoid it, or anything
21	like that.  There is a way to get by, but you don't have the necessary
21	resources right now.
22	Do you really want to quit now?
23	You fell into a pit and broke every bone in your body!
24	You are already carrying it!
25	You can't be serious!
26	The bird seemed unafraid at first, but as you approach it becomes
26	disturbed and you cannot catch it.
27	You can catch the bird, but you cannot carry it.
28	There is nothing here with a lock!
29	You aren't carrying it!
30	The little bird attacks the green snake, and in an astounding flurry
30	drives the snake away.
31	You have no keys!
32	It has no lock.
33	I don't know how to lock or unlock such a thing.
34	It was already locked.
35	The grate is now locked.
36	The grate is now unlocked.
37	It was already unlocked.
38	The urn is empty and will not light.
39	Your lamp is now on.
40	Your lamp is now off.
41	There is no way to get past the bear to unlock the chain, which is
41	probably just as well.
42	Nothing happens.
43	Where?
44	There is nothing here to attack.
45	The little bird is now dead.  Its body disappears.
46	Attacking the snake both doesn't work and is very dangerous.
47	You killed a little dwarf.
48	You attack a little dwarf, but he dodges out of the way.
49	With what?  Your bare hands?
50	Good try, but that is an old worn-out magic word.
51	I know of places, actions, and things.  Most of my vocabulary
51	describes places and is used to move you there.  To move, try words
51	like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south,
51	up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod
51	hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of
51	the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the
51	object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer
51	the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in
51	particular, "inventory" implies "take inventory", which causes me to
51	give you a list of what you're carrying.  Some objects have unexpected
51	effects; the effects are not always desirable!  Usually people having
51	trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people
51	trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something
51	beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely
51	different tack.  One point often confusing to beginners is that, when
51	there are several ways to go in a certain direction (e.g., if there
51	are several holes in a wall), choosing that direction in effect
51	chooses one of the ways at random; often, though, by specifying the
51	place you want to reach you can guarantee choosing the right path.
51	Also, to speed the game you can sometimes move long distances with a
51	single word.  For example, "building" usually gets you to the building
51	from anywhere above ground except when lost in the forest.  Also, note
51	that cave passages and forest paths turn a lot, so leaving one place
51	heading north doesn't guarantee entering the next from the south.
51	However (another important point), except when you've used a "long
51	distance" word such as "building", there is always a way to go back
51	where you just came from unless I warn you to the contrary, even
51	though the direction that takes you back might not be the reverse of
51	what got you here.  Good luck, and have fun!
52	There is no way to go that direction.
53	Please stick to 1- and 2-word commands.
54	OK
55	You can't unlock the keys.
56	You have crawled around in some little holes and wound up back in the
56	main passage.
57	I don't know where the cave is, but hereabouts no stream can run on
57	the surface for long.  I would try the stream.
58	I need more detailed instructions to do that.
59	I can only tell you what you see as you move about and manipulate
59	things.  I cannot tell you where remote things are.
60	The ogre snarls and shoves you back.
61	Huh?
62	Are you trying to get into the cave?
63	The grate is very solid and has a hardened steel lock.  You cannot
63	enter without a key, and there are no keys nearby.  I would recommend
63	looking elsewhere for the keys.
64	The trees of the forest are large hardwood oak and maple, with an
64	occasional grove of pine or spruce.  There is quite a bit of under-
64	growth, largely birch and ash saplings plus nondescript bushes of
64	various sorts.  This time of year visibility is quite restricted by
64	all the leaves, but travel is quite easy if you detour around the
64	spruce and berry bushes.
65	Welcome to Adventure!!  Would you like instructions?
66	Digging without a shovel is quite impractical.  Even with a shovel
66	progress is unlikely.
67	Blasting requires dynamite.
68	I'm as confused as you are.
69	Mist is a white vapor, usually water, seen from time to time in
69	caverns.  It can be found anywhere but is frequently a sign of a deep
69	pit leading down to water.
70	Your feet are now wet.
71	I think I just lost my appetite.
72	Thank you, it was delicious!
73	You have taken a drink from the stream.  The water tastes strongly of
73	minerals, but is not unpleasant.  It is extremely cold.
74	The bottle of water is now empty.
75	Rubbing the electric lamp is not particularly rewarding.  Anyway,
75	nothing exciting happens.
76	Peculiar.  Nothing unexpected happens.
77	Your bottle is empty and the ground is wet.
78	You can't pour that.
79	Watch it!
80	Which way?
81	Oh dear, you seem to have gotten yourself killed.  I might be able to
81	help you out, but I've never really done this before.  Do you want me
81	to try to reincarnate you?
82	All right.  But don't blame me if something goes wr......
82	                    --- POOF!! ---
82	You are engulfed in a cloud of orange smoke.  Coughing and gasping,
82	you emerge from the smoke and find....
83	You clumsy oaf, you've done it again!  I don't know how long I can
83	keep this up.  Do you want me to try reincarnating you again?
84	Okay, now where did I put my orange smoke?....  >POOF!<
84	Everything disappears in a dense cloud of orange smoke.
85	Now you've really done it!  I'm out of orange smoke!  You don't expect
85	me to do a decent reincarnation without any orange smoke, do you?
86	Okay, if you're so smart, do it yourself!  I'm leaving!
90	>>> messages 81 thru 90 are reserved for "obituaries". <<<
91	Sorry, but I no longer seem to remember how it was you got here.
92	You can't carry anything more.  You'll have to drop something first.
93	You can't go through a locked steel grate!
94	I believe what you want is right here with you.
95	You don't fit through a two-inch slit!
96	I respectfully suggest you go across the bridge instead of jumping.
97	There is no way across the fissure.
98	You're not carrying anything.
99	You are currently holding the following:
100	It's not hungry (it's merely pinin' for the fjords).  Besides, you
100	have no bird seed.
101	The snake has now devoured your bird.
102	There's nothing here it wants to eat (except perhaps you).
103	You fool, dwarves eat only coal!  Now you've made him *REALLY* mad!!
104	You have nothing in which to carry it.
105	Your bottle is already full.
106	There is nothing here with which to fill the bottle.
107	Your bottle is now full of water.
108	Your bottle is now full of oil.
109	You can't fill that.
110	Don't be ridiculous!
111	The door is extremely rusty and refuses to open.
112	The plant indignantly shakes the oil off its leaves and asks, "Water?"
113	The hinges are quite thoroughly rusted now and won't budge.
114	The oil has freed up the hinges so that the door will now move,
114	although it requires some effort.
115	The plant has exceptionally deep roots and cannot be pulled free.
116	The dwarves' knives vanish as they strike the walls of the cave.
117	Something you're carrying won't fit through the tunnel with you.
117	You'd best take inventory and drop something.
118	You can't fit this five-foot clam through that little passage!
119	You can't fit this five-foot oyster through that little passage!
120	I advise you to put down the clam before opening it.  >STRAIN!<
121	I advise you to put down the oyster before opening it.  >WRENCH!<
122	You don't have anything strong enough to open the clam.
123	You don't have anything strong enough to open the oyster.
124	A glistening pearl falls out of the clam and rolls away.  Goodness,
124	this must really be an oyster.  (I never was very good at identifying
124	bivalves.)  Whatever it is, it has now snapped shut again.
125	The oyster creaks open, revealing nothing but oyster inside.  It
125	promptly snaps shut again.
126	You have crawled around in some little holes and found your way
126	blocked by a recent cave-in.  You are now back in the main passage.
127	There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.
128	Out from the shadows behind you pounces a bearded pirate!  "Har, har,"
128	he chortles, "I'll just take all this booty and hide it away with me
128	chest deep in the maze!"  He snatches your treasure and vanishes into
128	the gloom.
129	A sepulchral voice reverberating through the cave, says, "Cave closing
129	soon.  All adventurers exit immediately through main office."
130	A mysterious recorded voice groans into life and announces:
130	   "This exit is closed.  Please leave via main office."
131	It looks as though you're dead.  Well, seeing as how it's so close to
131	closing time anyway, I think we'll just call it a day.
132	The sepulchral voice intones, "The cave is now closed."  As the echoes
132	fade, there is a blinding flash of light (and a small puff of orange
132	smoke). . . .    As your eyes refocus, you look around and find...
133	There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
133	wall, burying the dwarves in the rubble.  You march through the hole
133	and find yourself in the main office, where a cheering band of
133	friendly elves carry the conquering adventurer off into the sunset.
134	There is a loud explosion, and a twenty-foot hole appears in the far
134	wall, burying the snakes in the rubble.  A river of molten lava pours
134	in through the hole, destroying everything in its path, including you!
135	There is a loud explosion, and you are suddenly splashed across the
135	walls of the room.
136	The resulting ruckus has awakened the dwarves.  There are now several
136	threatening little dwarves in the room with you!  Most of them throw
136	knives at you!  All of them get you!
137	Oh, leave the poor unhappy bird alone.
138	I daresay whatever you want is around here somewhere.
139	I don't know the word "stop".  Use "quit" if you want to give up.
140	You can't get there from here.
141	You are being followed by a very large, tame bear.
142	For a summary of the most recent changes to the game, say "news".
142	If you want to end your adventure early, say "quit".  To suspend your
142	adventure such that you can continue later, say "suspend" (or "pause"
142	or "save").  To see how well you're doing, say "score".  To get full
142	credit for a treasure, you must have left it safely in the building,
142	though you get partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points
142	for getting killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more.
142	There are also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've
142	managed to explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for
142	getting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack),
142	and there are other ways to determine whether you've been through some
142	of the more harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the
142	treasures, just keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting
142	happens, you haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting
142	*DOES* happen (incidentally, there *ARE* ways to hasten things along),
142	it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many
142	more points in the Master's section.  I may occasionally offer hints
142	if you seem to be having trouble.  If I do, I'll warn you in advance
142	how much it will affect your score to accept the hints.  Finally, to
142	save time, you may specify "brief", which tells me never to repeat the
142	full description of a place unless you explicitly ask me to.
143	Now let's see you do it without suspending in mid-Adventure.
144	There is nothing here with which to fill it.
145	The sudden change in temperature has delicately shattered the vase.
146	It is beyond your power to do that.
147	I don't know how.
148	It is too far up for you to reach.
149	You killed a little dwarf.  The body vanishes in a cloud of greasy
149	black smoke.
150	The shell is very strong and is impervious to attack.
151	What's the matter, can't you read?  Now you'd best start over.
152	The axe bounces harmlessly off the dragon's thick scales.
153	The dragon looks rather nasty.  You'd best not try to get by.
154	The little bird attacks the green dragon, and in an astounding flurry
154	gets burnt to a cinder.  The ashes blow away.
155	On what?
156	Okay, from now on I'll only describe a place in full the first time
156	you come to it.  To get the full description, say "look".
157	Trolls are close relatives with the rocks and have skin as tough as
157	that of a rhinoceros.  The troll fends off your blows effortlessly.
158	The troll deftly catches the axe, examines it carefully, and tosses it
158	back, declaring, "Good workmanship, but it's not valuable enough."
159	The troll catches your treasure and scurries away out of sight.
160	The troll refuses to let you cross.
161	There is no longer any way across the chasm.
162	Just as you reach the other side, the bridge buckles beneath the
162	weight of the bear, which was still following you around.  You
162	scrabble desperately for support, but as the bridge collapses you
162	stumble back and fall into the chasm.
163	The bear lumbers toward the troll, who lets out a startled shriek and
163	scurries away.  The bear soon gives up the pursuit and wanders back.
164	The axe misses and lands near the bear where you can't get at it.
165	With what?  Your bare hands?  Against *HIS* bear hands??
166	The bear is confused; he only wants to be your friend.
167	For crying out loud, the poor thing is already dead!
168	The bear eagerly wolfs down your food, after which he seems to calm
168	down considerably and even becomes rather friendly.
169	The bear is still chained to the wall.
170	The chain is still locked.
171	The chain is now unlocked.
172	The chain is now locked.
173	There is nothing here to which the chain can be locked.
174	There is nothing here to eat.
175	Do you want the hint?
176	Do you need help getting out of the maze?
177	You can make the passages look less alike by dropping things.
178	Are you trying to explore beyond the plover room?
179	There is a way to explore that region without having to worry about
179	falling into a pit.  None of the objects available is immediately
179	useful in discovering the secret.
180	Do you need help getting out of here?
181	Don't go west.
182	Gluttony is not one of the troll's vices.  Avarice, however, is.
183	Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best start wrapping this up, unless
183	you can find some fresh batteries.  I seem to recall there's a vending
183	machine in the maze.  Bring some coins with you.
184	Your lamp has run out of power.
185	Please answer the question.
186	There are faint rustling noises from the darkness behind you.  As you
186	turn toward them, the beam of your lamp falls across a bearded pirate.
186	He is carrying a large chest.  "Shiver me timbers!" he cries, "I've
186	been spotted!  I'd best hie meself off to the maze to hide me chest!"
186	With that, he vanishes into the gloom.
187	Your lamp is getting dim.  You'd best go back for those batteries.
188	Your lamp is getting dim.  I'm taking the liberty of replacing the
188	batteries.
189	Your lamp is getting dim, and you're out of spare batteries.  You'd
189	best start wrapping this up.
190	You sift your fingers through the dust, but succeed only in
190	obliterating the cryptic message.
191	Do you need help dealing with the ogre?
192	Hmmm, this looks like a clue, which means it'll cost you 10 points to
192	read it.  Should I go ahead and read it anyway?
193	It says, "There is a way out of this place.  Do you need any more
193	information to escape?  Sorry, but this initial hint is all you get."
194	There is nothing the presence of which will prevent you from defeating
194	him; thus it can't hurt to fetch everything you possibly can.
195	I'm afraid I don't understand.
196	Your hand passes through it as though it weren't there.
197	You strike the mirror a resounding blow, whereupon it shatters into a
197	myriad tiny fragments.
198	You have taken the vase and hurled it delicately to the ground.
199	You prod the nearest dwarf, who wakes up grumpily, takes one look at
199	you, curses, and grabs for his axe.
200	Is this acceptable?
201	This adventure is already over.  To start a new adventure, or to
201	resume an earlier adventure, please run a fresh copy of the program.
202	The ogre doesn't appear to be hungry.
203	The ogre, who despite his bulk is quite agile, easily dodges your
203	attack.  He seems almost amused by your puny effort.
204	The ogre, distracted by your rush, is struck by the knife.  With a
204	blood-curdling yell he turns and bounds after the dwarves, who flee
204	in panic.  You are left alone in the room.
205	The ogre, distracted by your rush, is struck by the knife.  With a
205	blood-curdling yell he turns and bounds after the dwarf, who flees
205	in panic.  You are left alone in the room.
206	The bird flies about agitatedly for a moment.
207	The bird flies agitatedly about the cage.
208	The bird flies about agitatedly for a moment, then disappears through
208	the crack.  It reappears shortly, carrying in its beak a jade
208	necklace, which it drops at your feet.
209	The urn is now lit.
210	The urn is now dark.
211	You empty the bottle into the urn, which promptly ejects the water
211	with uncanny accuracy, squirting you directly between the eyes.
212	Your bottle is now empty and the urn is full of oil.
213	The urn is already full of oil.
214	There's no way to get the oil out of the urn.
215	The urn is far too firmly embedded for your puny strength to budge it.
216	As you rub the urn, there is a flash of light and a genie appears.
216	His aspect is stern as he advises: "One who wouldst traffic in
216	precious stones must first learn to recognize the signals thereof."
216	He wrests the urn from the stone, leaving a small cavity.  Turning to
216	face you again, he fixes you with a steely eye and intones: "Caution!"
216	Genie and urn vanish in a cloud of amber smoke.  The smoke condenses
216	to form a rare amber gemstone, resting in the cavity in the rock.
217	I suppose you collect doughnut holes, too?
218	The gem fits easily into the cavity.
219	The persian rug stiffens and rises a foot or so off the ground.
220	The persian rug draped over your shoulder seems to wriggle for a
220	moment, but then subsides.
221	The persian rug settles gently to the ground.
222	The rug hovers stubbornly where it is.
223	The rug does not appear inclined to cooperate.
224	If you mean to use the persian rug, it does not appear inclined to
224	cooperate.
225	Though you flap your arms furiously, it is to no avail.
226	You board the persian rug, which promptly whisks you across the chasm.
226	You have time for a fleeting glimpse of a two thousand foot drop to a
226	mighty river; then you find yourself on the other side.
227	The rug ferries you back across the chasm.
228	All is silent.
229	The stream is gurgling placidly.
230	The wind whistles coldly past your ears.
231	The stream splashes loudly into the pool.
232	You are unable to make anything of the splashing noise.
233	You can hear the murmuring of the beanstalks and the snoring of the
233	dwarves.
234	A loud hissing emanates from the snake pit.
235	The air is filled with a dull rumbling sound.
236	The roar is quite loud here.
237	The roaring is so loud that it drowns out all other sound.
238	The bird eyes you suspiciously and flutters away.  A moment later you
238	feel something wet land on your head, but upon looking up you can see
238	no sign of the culprit.
239	There are only a few drops--not enough to carry.
240	Your head buzzes strangely for a moment.
241	(Uh, y'know, that wasn't very bright.)
242	It's a pity you took so long about it.
243	Are you wondering what to do here?
244	This section is quite advanced.  Find the cave first.
245	Upstream or downstream?
246	Wizards are not to be disturbed by such as you.
247	Would you like to be shown out of the forest?
248	Go east ten times.  If that doesn't get you out, then go south, then
248	west twice, then south.
249	The waters are crashing loudly against the shore.
250	%1 of them throw knives at you!
251	%1 of them get you!
252	One of them gets you!
253	None of them hits you!
254	Sorry, I don't know the word "%W".
255	What do you want to do with the %L?
256	I see no %L here.
257	%C what?
258	Okay, "%W".
259	You have garnered %3 out of a possible %3 points, using %5 turn%S.
260	I can suspend your Adventure for you so that you can resume later, but
260	it will cost you 5 points.
261	I am prepared to give you a hint, but it will cost you %1 point%S.
262	You scored %3 out of a possible %3, using%5 turn%S.
263	To achieve the next higher rating, you need %2 more point%S.
264	To achieve the next higher rating would be a neat trick!
264	Congratulations!!
265	You just went off my scale!!
266	To resume your Adventure, start a new game and then say "RESUME".
267	Table space used:
267	%6 of %6 words of messages   %6 of %6 travel options
267	%6 of %6 vocabulary words    %6 of %6 locations
267	%6 of %6 objects             %6 of %6 action verbs
267	%6 of %6 "random" messages   %6 of %6 "class" messages
267	%6 of %6 hints               %6 of %6 turn threshholds
268	To resume an earlier Adventure, you must abandon the current one.
269	I'm sorry, but that Adventure was begun using Version%2.%1 of the
269	program, and this is Version%2.%1.  You must find the other version
269	in order to resume that Adventure.
270	A dark fog creeps in to surround you.  From somewhere in the fog you
270	hear a stern voice.  "This Adventure has been tampered with!  You have
270	been dabbling in magic, knowing not the havoc you might cause thereby.
270	Leave at once, before you do irrevocable harm!"  The fog thickens,
270	until at last you can see nothing at all.  Your vision then clears,
270	and you find yourself back in The Real World.
271	Guess again.
272	You're missing only one other treasure.  Do you need help finding it?
273	Once you've found all the other treasures, it is no longer possible to
273	locate the one you're now missing.
274	Sorry, but the path twisted and turned so much that I can't figure
274	out which way to go to get back.
275	Version 2.5 is essentially the same as Version II; the cave and the
275	hazards therein are unchanged, and top score is still 430 points.
275	There are a few more hints, especially for some of the more obscure
275	puzzles.  There are a few minor bugfixes and cosmetic changes.  You
275	can now save a game and resume it at once (formerly you had to wait a
275	while first), but it now costs you a few points each time you save the
275	game.  Saved games are now stored in much smaller files than before.
276	You don't have to say "go" every time; just specify a direction or, if
276	it's nearby, name the place to which you wish to move.
