1	You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building.
1	Around you is a forest.  A small stream flows out of the building and
1	down a gully.
2	You have walked up a hill, still in the forest.  The road slopes back
2	down the other side of the hill.  There is a building in the distance.
3	You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
4	You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling along a
4	rocky bed.
5	The road, which approaches from the east, ends here amid the trees.
6	The forest thins out here to reveal a steep cliff.  There is no way
6	down, but a small ledge can be seen to the west across the chasm.
7	At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a 2-inch slit
7	in the rock.  Downstream the streambed is bare rock.
8	You are in a 20-foot depression floored with bare dirt.  Set into the
8	dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in concrete.  A dry streambed
8	leads into the depression.
9	You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to the surface.
9	A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to the west.
10	You are crawling over cobbles in a low passage.  There is a dim light
10	at the east end of the passage.
11	You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from the surface.
11	A low wide passage with cobbles becomes plugged with mud and debris
11	here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  In the mud someone
11	has scrawled, "MAGIC WORD XYZZY".
12	You are in an awkward sloping east/west canyon.
13	You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls are frozen
13	rivers of orange stone.  An awkward canyon and a good passage exit
13	from east and west sides of the chamber.
14	At your feet is a small pit breathing traces of white mist.  An east
14	passage ends here except for a small crack leading on.
15	You are at one end of a vast hall stretching forward out of sight to
15	the west.  There are openings to either side.  Nearby, a wide stone
15	staircase leads downward.  The hall is filled with wisps of white mist
15	swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  A cold wind blows up the
15	staircase.  There is a passage at the top of a dome behind you.
16	The crack is far too small for you to follow.  At its widest it is
16	barely wide enough to admit your foot.
17	You are on the east bank of a fissure slicing clear across the hall.
17	The mist is quite thick here, and the fissure is too wide to jump.
18	This is a low room with a crude note on the wall.  The note says,
18	"You won't get it up the steps".
19	You are in the Hall of the Mountain King, with passages off in all
19	directions.
20	You are at the bottom of the pit with a broken neck.
21	You didn't make it.
22	The dome is unclimbable.
23	You are at the west end of the Twopit Room.  There is a large hole in
23	the wall above the pit at this end of the room.
24	You are at the bottom of the eastern pit in the Twopit Room.  There is
24	a small pool of oil in one corner of the pit.
25	You are at the bottom of the western pit in the Twopit Room.  There is
25	a large hole in the wall about 25 feet above you.
26	You clamber up the plant and scurry through the hole at the top.
27	You are on the west side of the fissure in the Hall of Mists.
28	You are in a low n/s passage at a hole in the floor.  The hole goes
28	down to an e/w passage.
29	You are in the south side chamber.
30	You are in the west side chamber of the Hall of the Mountain King.
30	A passage continues west and up here.
31	%!
32	You can't get by the snake.
33	You are in a large room, with a passage to the south, a passage to the
33	west, and a wall of broken rock to the east.  There is a large "Y2" on
33	a rock in the room's center.
34	You are in a jumble of rock, with cracks everywhere.
35	You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
35	sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
35	white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the right.
35	Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
35	someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
35	25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
35	shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
36	You are in a dirty broken passage.  To the east is a crawl.  To the
36	west is a large passage.  Above you is a hole to another passage.
37	You are on the brink of a small clean climbable pit.  A crawl leads
37	west.
38	You are in the bottom of a small pit with a little stream, which
38	enters and exits through tiny slits.
39	You are in a large room full of dusty rocks.  There is a big hole in
39	the floor.  There are cracks everywhere, and a passage leading east.
40	You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
40	of the Hall of Mists.
41	You are at the west end of the Hall of Mists.  A low wide crawl
41	continues west and another goes north.  To the south is a little
41	passage 6 feet off the floor.
42	You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
43	You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.

57	You are on the brink of a thirty foot pit with a massive orange column
57	down one wall.  You could climb down here but you could not get back
57	up.  The maze continues at this level.
58	Dead end
59	You have crawled through a very low wide passage parallel to and north
59	of the Hall of Mists.
60	You are at the east end of a very long hall apparently without side
60	chambers.  To the east a low wide crawl slants up.  To the north a
60	round two foot hole slants down.
61	You are at the west end of a very long featureless hall.  The hall
61	joins up with a narrow north/south passage.
62	You are at a crossover of a high n/s passage and a low e/w one.
63	Dead end
64	You are at a complex junction.  A low hands and knees passage from the
64	north joins a higher crawl from the east to make a walking passage
64	going west.  There is also a large room above.  The air is damp here.
65	You are in Bedquilt, a long east/west passage with holes everywhere.
65	To explore at random select north, south, up, or down.
66	You are in a room whose walls resemble swiss cheese.  Obvious passages
66	go west, east, ne, and nw.  Part of the room is occupied by a large
66	bedrock block.
67	You are at the east end of the Twopit Room.  The floor here is
67	littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy to descend the pits.
67	There is a path here bypassing the pits to connect passages from east
67	and west.  There are holes all over, but the only big one is on the
67	wall directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.
68	You are in a large low circular chamber whose floor is an immense slab
68	fallen from the ceiling (Slab Room).  East and west there once were
68	large passages, but they are now filled with boulders.  Low small
68	passages go north and south, and the south one quickly bends west
68	around the boulders.
69	You are in a secret n/s canyon above a large room.
70	You are in a secret n/s canyon above a sizable passage.
71	You are in a secret canyon at a junction of three canyons, bearing
71	north, south, and se.  The north one is as tall as the other two
71	combined.
72	You are in a large low room.  Crawls lead north, se, and sw.
73	Dead end crawl.
74	You are in a secret canyon which here runs e/w.  It crosses over a
74	very tight canyon 15 feet below.  If you go down you may not be able
74	to get back up.
75	You are at a wide place in a very tight n/s canyon.
76	The canyon here becomes too tight to go further south.
77	You are in a tall e/w canyon.  A low tight crawl goes 3 feet north and
77	seems to open up.
78	The canyon runs into a mass of boulders -- dead end.
79	The stream flows out through a pair of 1 foot diameter sewer pipes.
79	It would be advisable to use the exit.

87	You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
88	You are in a long, narrow corridor stretching out of sight to the
88	west.  At the eastern end is a hole through which you can see a
88	profusion of leaves.
89	There is nothing here to climb.  Use "up" or "out" to leave the pit.
90	You have climbed up the plant and out of the pit.
91	You are at the top of a steep incline above a large room.  You could
91	climb down here, but you would not be able to climb up.  There is a
91	passage leading back to the north.
92	You are in the Giant Room.  The ceiling here is too high up for your
92	lamp to show it.  Cavernous passages lead east, north, and south.  On
92	the west wall is scrawled the inscription, "FEE FIE FOE FOO" [sic].
93	The passage here is blocked by a recent cave-in.
94	You are at one end of an immense north/south passage.
95	You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream, which cascades
95	over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring whirlpool which disappears
95	through a hole in the floor.  Passages exit to the south and west.
96	You are in the Soft Room.  The walls are covered with heavy curtains,
96	the floor with a thick pile carpet.  Moss covers the ceiling.
97	This is the Oriental Room.  Ancient oriental cave drawings cover the
97	walls.  A gently sloping passage leads upward to the north, another
97	passage leads se, and a hands and knees crawl leads west.
98	You are following a wide path around the outer edge of a large cavern.
98	Far below, through a heavy white mist, strange splashing noises can be
98	heard.  The mist rises up through a fissure in the ceiling.  The path
98	exits to the south and west.
99	You are in an alcove.  A small nw path seems to widen after a short
99	distance.  An extremely tight tunnel leads east.  It looks like a very
99	tight squeeze.  An eerie light can be seen at the other end.
100	You're in a small chamber lit by an eerie green light.  An extremely
100	narrow tunnel exits to the west.  A dark corridor leads ne.
101	You're in the dark-room.  A corridor leading south is the only exit.
102	You are in an arched hall.  A coral passage once continued up and east
102	from here, but is now blocked by debris.  The air smells of sea water.
103	You're in a large room carved out of sedimentary rock.  The floor and
103	walls are littered with bits of shells imbedded in the stone.  A
103	shallow passage proceeds downward, and a somewhat steeper one leads
103	up.  A low hands and knees passage enters from the south.
104	You are in a long sloping corridor with ragged sharp walls.
105	You are in a cul-de-sac about eight feet across.
106	You are in an anteroom leading to a large passage to the east.  Small
106	passages go west and up.  The remnants of recent digging are evident.
106	A sign in midair here says "Cave under construction beyond this point.
106	Proceed at own risk.  [Witt Construction Company]"
107	You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all different.
108	You are at Witt's End.  Passages lead off in *ALL* directions.
109	You are in a north/south canyon about 25 feet across.  The floor is
109	covered by white mist seeping in from the north.  The walls extend
109	upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended from some unseen point far
109	above you, an enormous two-sided mirror is hanging parallel to and
109	midway between the canyon walls.  (The mirror is obviously provided
109	for the use of the dwarves who, as you know, are extremely vain.)  A
109	small window can be seen in either wall, some fifty feet up.
110	You're at a low window overlooking a huge pit, which extends up out of
110	sight.  A floor is indistinctly visible over 50 feet below.  Traces of
110	white mist cover the floor of the pit, becoming thicker to the left.
110	Marks in the dust around the window would seem to indicate that
110	someone has been here recently.  Directly across the pit from you and
110	25 feet away there is a similar window looking into a lighted room.  A
110	shadowy figure can be seen there peering back at you.
111	A large stalactite extends from the roof and almost reaches the floor
111	below.  You could climb down it, and jump from it to the floor, but
111	having done so you would be unable to reach it to climb back up.
112	You are in a little maze of twisting passages, all different.
113	You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.  An opaque cloud
113	of white mist fills the room and rises rapidly upward.  The lake is
113	fed by a stream, which tumbles out of a hole in the wall about 10 feet
113	overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere within the
113	mist.  There is a passage going back toward the south.
114	Dead end
115	You are at the northeast end of an immense room, even larger than the
115	Giant Room.  It appears to be a repository for the "Adventure"
115	program.  Massive torches far overhead bathe the room with smoky
115	yellow light.  Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all
115	of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed
115	of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and
115	a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves
115	are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A notice nearby reads: "Do
115	not disturb the dwarves!"  An immense mirror is hanging against one
115	wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other
115	sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.
116	You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a pit
116	full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small
116	wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one
116	corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends.  A
116	large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor.  A
116	vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your feet is a large
116	steel grate, next to which is a sign that reads, "Treasure Vault.
116	Keys in main office."
117	You are on one side of a large, deep chasm.  A heavy white mist rising
117	up from below obscures all view of the far side.  A sw path leads away
117	from the chasm into a winding corridor.
118	You are in a long winding corridor sloping out of sight in both
118	directions.
119	You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
120	You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
121	You are in a secret canyon which exits to the north and east.
122	You are on the far side of the chasm.  A ne path leads away from the
122	chasm on this side.
123	You're in a long east/west corridor.  A faint rumbling noise can be
123	heard in the distance.
124	The path forks here.  The left fork leads northeast.  A dull rumbling
124	seems to get louder in that direction.  The right fork leads southeast
124	down a gentle slope.  The main corridor enters from the west.
125	The walls are quite warm here.  From the north can be heard a steady
125	roar, so loud that the entire cave seems to be trembling.  Another
125	passage leads south, and a low crawl goes east.
126	You are on the edge of a breath-taking view.  Far below you is an
126	active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging
126	out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the
126	farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-
126	thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering
126	sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to
126	the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other
126	sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted
126	formations composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky
126	light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep
126	gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock which seems to
126	have been crafted by the devil himself.  An immense river of fire
126	crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the
126	gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To
126	the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously
126	from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles
126	ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its
126	own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already
126	hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.
127	You are in a small chamber filled with large boulders.  The walls are
127	very warm, causing the air in the room to be almost stifling from the
127	heat.  The only exit is a crawl heading west, through which is coming
127	a low rumbling.
128	You are walking along a gently sloping north/south passage lined with
128	oddly shaped limestone formations.
129	You are standing at the entrance to a large, barren room.  A notice
129	above the entrance reads:  "Caution!  Bear in room!"
130	You are inside a barren room.  The center of the room is completely
130	empty except for some dust.  Marks in the dust lead away toward the
130	far end of the room.  The only exit is the way you came in.
131	You are in a maze of twisting little passages, all different.

142	There is no way to go that direction.

167	You are on a small ledge on one face of a sheer cliff.  There are no
167	paths away from the ledge.  Across the chasm is a small clearing
167	surrounded by forest.
168	You are walking across the bottom of the reservoir.  Walls of water
168	rear up on either side.  The roar of the water cascading past is
168	nearly deafening, and the mist is so thick you can barely see.
169	You are at the northern edge of the reservoir.  A northwest passage
169	leads sharply up from here.
170	You are scrambling along a treacherously steep, rocky passage.
171	You are on a very steep incline, which widens at it goes upward.
172	You are at the base of a nearly vertical cliff.  There are some
172	slim footholds which would enable you to climb up, but it looks
172	extremely dangerous.  Here at the base of the cliff lie the remains
172	of several earlier adventurers who apparently failed to make it.
173	You are climbing along a nearly vertical cliff.
174	Just as you reach the top, your foot slips on a loose rock and you
174	tumble several hundred feet to join the other unlucky adventurers.
175	Just as you reach the top, your foot slips on a loose rock and you
175	make one last desperate grab.  Your luck holds, as does your grip.
175	With an enormous heave, you lift yourself to the ledge above.
176	You are on a small ledge at the top of a nearly vertical cliff.
176	There is a low crawl leading off to the northeast.
177	You have reached a dead end.
178	There is now one more gruesome aspect to the spectacular vista.
