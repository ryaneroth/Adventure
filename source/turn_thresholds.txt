200350	Tsk!  A wizard wouldn't have to take 350 turns.  This is going to cost
200350	you a couple of points.
300500	500 turns?  That's another few points you've lost.
501000	Are you still at it?  Five points off for exceeding 1000 turns!
1002500 Good grief, don't you *EVER* give up?  Do you realize you've spent
1002500 over 2500 turns at this?  That's another ten points off, a total of
1002500 twenty points lost for taking so long.
